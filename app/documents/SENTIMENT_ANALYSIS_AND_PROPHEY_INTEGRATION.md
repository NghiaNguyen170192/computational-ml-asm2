## Literature Review and Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Sentiment Analysis in Financial Markets

The integration of sentiment analysis in financial markets has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of cryptocurrency markets. Research by Bollen et al. (2011) demonstrated that Twitter sentiment could predict stock market movements with 87.6% accuracy. In the cryptocurrency domain, studies by Kim et al. (2016) and Chen et al. (2018) have shown that social media sentiment significantly impacts Bitcoin price volatility.

#### 2.1.1 Market Psychology and Behavioral Finance

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) suggests that asset prices reflect all available information. However, behavioral finance research has revealed that market participants are not always rational, leading to systematic biases and sentiment-driven price movements. In cryptocurrency markets, these effects are amplified due to:

- **High Retail Participation**: Cryptocurrency markets have a higher proportion of retail investors compared to traditional markets
- **24/7 Trading**: Continuous market operation allows sentiment to impact prices around the clock
- **Media Influence**: Cryptocurrency news receives disproportionate media attention, amplifying sentiment effects
- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Frequent regulatory announcements create significant sentiment swings

#### 2.1.2 Sentiment Analysis Methodologies

Traditional sentiment analysis approaches include:

1. **Lexicon-Based Methods**: Using predefined dictionaries of positive and negative words
2. **Machine Learning Approaches**: Training classifiers on labeled sentiment data
3. **Deep Learning Models**: Using neural networks for complex sentiment understanding
4. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining multiple methods for improved accuracy

### 2.2 Time Series Forecasting with External Regressors

Time series forecasting has evolved significantly with the introduction of external regressors. Prophet, developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team, represents a significant advancement in this field by providing:

- **Automatic Seasonality Detection**: Identifying yearly, weekly, and daily patterns
- **Holiday Effects**: Incorporating known events that affect time series
- **External Regressor Support**: Integrating additional variables that influence the target variable
- **Robust Handling of Missing Data**: Managing gaps and outliers in time series data

#### 2.2.1 Prophet's Mathematical Foundation

Prophet uses an additive model where the time series is decomposed into:

```
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + ε(t)
```

Where:
- `g(t)` represents the trend component
- `s(t)` represents seasonal effects
- `h(t)` represents holiday effects
- `ε(t)` represents error terms

The external regressors are incorporated through additional terms in the model, allowing for the integration of sentiment data and other relevant variables.

### 2.3 Cryptocurrency Market Characteristics

Cryptocurrency markets exhibit unique characteristics that make them particularly suitable for sentiment-based prediction:

1. **High Volatility**: Bitcoin's daily volatility often exceeds 5%, compared to 1-2% for traditional assets
2. **News Sensitivity**: Price movements are highly correlated with news events and social media sentiment
3. **Global Nature**: 24/7 trading across multiple time zones creates continuous sentiment impact
4. **Regulatory Dependence**: Government announcements significantly impact market sentiment
5. **Technology Focus**: Technical developments and security concerns drive market sentiment

## Prophet Integration Framework

### 4.1 Prophet Model Architecture for Sentiment Integration

Prophet's flexible architecture makes it particularly suitable for integrating sentiment analysis with time series forecasting. The model's additive structure allows for seamless incorporation of external regressors while maintaining interpretability and robustness.

#### 4.1.1 Model Decomposition with Sentiment Regressors

The enhanced Prophet model incorporates sentiment data through three primary external regressors:

**Sentiment Polarity Regressor (β₁ × sentiment_polarity)**
- Captures the directional impact of market sentiment
